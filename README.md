A console-based Bank Management System using C programming that enables essential banking operations, providing a simplified and efficient user experience.
Key Features:

1. Account Creation:

Users can create new accounts, where each account has a unique account number, name, and an initial balance set to zero.



2. Deposit Functionality:

Allows users to deposit funds into their account. It updates the balance and stores the updated details in a binary file for persistence.



3. Withdrawal Option:

Users can securely withdraw money if their balance meets the withdrawal amount, with validation for insufficient funds.



4. Balance Inquiry:

Provides real-time balance information to the user based on the account number.



5. Data Persistence:

Utilizes binary file handling to store and retrieve account details, ensuring data integrity across sessions.




Technical Aspects:

Language: C

File Handling: Utilized for data storage and retrieval of account information.

Structs: Designed a structured data type for bank accounts, allowing clean organization of account details.

Modular Design: Each feature is implemented as a separate function for maintainability and readability.

Console-Based Interface: User-friendly and intuitive console interface with navigation options.


Learning Outcomes:
This project honed my skills in file handling, conditional logic, and structured data management in C. It gave me hands-on experience with real-world banking operations simulated through programming and provided a deep understanding of project structuring and data persistence.
